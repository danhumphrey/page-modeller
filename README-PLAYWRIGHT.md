## Playwright Support
Page modeller currently supports below Playwright strategies:  
CSS Selector  
XPath Selector  

### Note on Playwright-specific selectors
Playwright supports selectors with pseudo-class, some examples as below:  
``button:text-matches("Reg?ex","i")``  
``button:has-text("Submit")``  
such Playwright specific selectors will not be generated by Page modeller at the moment.  

If needed, use Playwright Inspector to create such selectors, bring their selector text over to Page Modeller and have it under CSS locator strategy's selector text.
